\title{MathTL --- Mathematical Template Library}
\author{Thorsten Raasch}
\maketitle

\section{Motivation}
Inspired by the abbreviation STL for \textit{Standard Template Library},
this library for mathematical purposes has been given the name MathTL.
The library shall provide powerful mathematical tools from many different fields,
especially linear algebra, geometry and numerical analysis.
It is completely written in C++ and heavily relies on the concept of \textit{templates}.
This not only allows for simply including the library code
in your own programs instead of having to link against it,
but also enables the C++ compiler to do significant optimizations
at compile time. It is known that C++ code which extensively uses templates in the right way
can outperform the equivalent C or Fortran code drastically.
